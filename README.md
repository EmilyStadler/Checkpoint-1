# Checkpoint-1
Bloc Intro

#### Things I hope to achieve during Bloc:
1. Learn how to code. 
2. Figure out how to use Github without feeling like an idiot.
3. Collaborate with others in my class on some projects, even if they are outside of normal classwork.
4. Gain the confidence needed to ace an interview.
5. Attend some local meetups and network with others in Portland. 
6. Become a _kick-A developer_ :)
